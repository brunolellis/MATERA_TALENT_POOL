# employees-api

Sample project to handle employees, creating, updating, retrieving and deleting (actually disabling) employees, exposing Employee resource through a REST API.


## API first
The idea is to start with the API definition, so it allows better alignment between a service producer and client consumers - also within our team.

Employee API definition can be found [here](src/main/resources/static/swagger.yml). The api definition is also embedded and available while the service is running ([here](http://localhost:8080/swagger.yml)). 

Please, copy and paste the definition on [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) for better visualization.
